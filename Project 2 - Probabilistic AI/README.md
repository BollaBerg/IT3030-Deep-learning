# Probabilistic AI
This repo contains code for Project 2 of IT3030 - Deep Learning taken during the spring of 2022.

### Requirements
Found in `requirements.txt` (as always). This project is running on `python 3.10.1`

**IMPORTANT:** PyTorch does not yet support Python `3.10`, so PyTorch Nightly must be installed for the project to work:
```bash
pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu113/torch_nightly.html
# Alternative for only CPU support:
# pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu/torch_nightly.html
```
